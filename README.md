This is a README file for a Node.js project using Express.

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js from the official website if it's not already installed.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script `./run.sh` to install dependencies and set up the project.
4. Once the setup is complete, start the server by running `node app.js`.
5. The server will be available at http://localhost:3000.

The project is structured as follows:

* `app.js`: The main entry point for the server, sets up the Express server, defines routes, and starts the server.
* `routes.js`: Defines RESTful API routes for users, orders, and products.
* `controllers/`: Contains controllers for user, order, and product management.
* `services/`: Contains services for authentication, order creation, and product retrieval.
* `models/`: Contains database models for users, orders, and products.
* `db.js`: Sets up the SQLite database connection.

Configuration and environment variables are stored in `.env`.

Note: Make sure to install Node.js and run `./run.sh` before starting the server.
